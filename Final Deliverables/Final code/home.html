                <h1>Detect if your plant is infected!!!</h1>
                <p class="Details">Agriculture is one of the major sectors world wide. Over the years it has developed
                    and the use of
                    technologies and equipment replaced almost all the traditional methods of farming. The plant disease
                    affects the production. Identification of the disease and taking necessary precautions is all done
                    through naked eye, which requires labours and laboratories. This application helps farmers in
                    detecting the disease by observing the spots in the leaves, which in turn saves effort and labour
                    cost.</p>
